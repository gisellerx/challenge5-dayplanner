# <05 Work Day Scheduler>

## Description

This website containes a daily planner to create a schedule. When I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When I scroll down, then I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm. When I view the time blocks for that day, then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When I click into a time block, then I can enter an event. When I click the save button for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage. When I refresh the page, then the saved events persist.
